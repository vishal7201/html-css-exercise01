            <h3>Travel</h3>
            <p>The 'Queen of Hills' might have lost some of her gleam, but it undoubtedly is one of the most-preferred mountain retreats. Discovered by the weary British, it continued to be a cool getaway for them and the then royalties of India. And why not. Where else can you get stunning views of the Himalayan range, endless trekking options, colonial bungalows exuding old-world charm and picture-perfect picnic spots. Mussoorie itself is perched on a horse-shoe shaped ridge, best explored on foot. The Mall is the hub of all activities and the cool air would reveal your sense of romance! It is home to the icon of Indian writing, Ruskin Bond, who has been living here for close to 45 years. Walk along the Mall, drive down to Dhanaulti..</p>
